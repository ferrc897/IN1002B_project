## Can I generate an additional income renting a room or my house on Airbnb?

Today, with the help of websites such as Uber, Airbnb or Wallapop it is possible generate an extra income to complement or even cover everyday expenses of a person or family. You may possibly have an extra room or a free apartment, in the case of having moved homes or if your children have moved out.

### For instance

Carina lives in the Hipodromo Condesa neighborhood in Mexico City. Carina is retired and has a furnished room that she would like to rent to generate an extra income besides her pension. Her apartment is well located, in the Cholula Street, close to the Condesa neighbohood, the España Park and the Bosque de Chapultepec. Carina is considering offering her room, or even her entire apartment on Airbnb.

Carina’s apartment is in excellent conditions and is 65m2, has 2 bedrooms with full beds, a bathroom, living room, dining room, kitchen and a washing area. It also has Wi-Fi but does not have a parking space.

Carina got a database from Airbnb with the public information of the offers in Mexico City. How can she use this information to estimate the price of the rent of the room or the apartment? Can you identify the factors that provide a capital gain to a property? Can this be applied to other properties in different locations or even in different cities?
